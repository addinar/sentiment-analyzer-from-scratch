# sentiment-analyzer-from-scratch

## Description
This is a simple sentiment analysis model made entirely from numPy, re, and NLTK alone. During development, pandas and matplotlib were also used. The model uses self-made embeddings, positional encodings, transformers, and logits. It employs several concepts from calculus and linear algebra to perform the forward and backward passes. 

The model was trained on 467 entries of [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nursyahrina/chat-sentiment-dataset) from KaggleHub.

Given that this model was developed from scratch using limited samples, it is primitive and makes the best predictions from simple, straightforward sentences, similar to the ones you can see in the dataset.
